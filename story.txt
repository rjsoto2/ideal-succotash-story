Gary is out of food! So Spongebob leaves to the Krusty Krab
to find any leftovers to bring to Gary. But, Mr. Krabs wants to keep
them to reuse for the next day.

Spongebob knows that Gary is really hungry, so he enlists the help of Patrick. He and Patrick come up with a super secret plan to perform a daring heist of the leftovers. Ready to burgle some burgers, Spongebob and Patrick head over to the Krusty Krab to commence operation Burger Burglars.
