Gary is out of food! So Spongebob leaves to the Krusty Krab
to find any leftovers to bring to Gary. But, Mr. Krabs wants to keep
them to reuse for the next day.

Spongebob knows that Gary is really hungry, so he enlists the help of Patrick. He and Patrick come up with a super secret plan to perform a daring heist of the leftovers. Ready to burgle some burgers, Spongebob and Patrick head over to the Krusty Krab to commence operation Burger Burglars.

Right as they sneak into the Krusty Krab, they are met with a horrible 
discovery... Squidward has already eaten all of the leftover krabby 
patties! With no other options left, Spongebob and Patrick head out 
for their last resort... The Chum Buckt

Spongebob and Patrick sneak on the Chum Buck, Sheldon is not here but Karen is power-off. They try to find something to take away but they find a bottle 
which has the nametag "recipe of Krabby patties" on it.
